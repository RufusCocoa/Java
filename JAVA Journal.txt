Java Language Journal

- Starting -
The first line has to be: 

public class Main {
	public static void main(

Every line of code that can actually run needs to be inside a class. This line declares a class named 'Main', which is public, 
that means that any other class or file can access it.
Don't forget to make the capital M on Main or it won't work when defining a class.
Don't forget to close commands with ; 


- Line Commands -

	public - again means that anyone can access it.
	static - means that you can run this method without creating an instance of Main.
	void - means that this method doesn't return any value.
	main - the class

- Commands -

	Declaring a Variable-
	***Once a variable is declared you don't need to declare it's type again and can change it's value (below).
int myNumber;
myNumber = 5;
	***or
String variablename= value
	***For maths and such use doubles, floats and ints. Int is a whole number, so no decimals. Float is a decimal number, but can't be a whole. 
	***Double can be either.
	
	Print Text-
System.out.println("text here");
